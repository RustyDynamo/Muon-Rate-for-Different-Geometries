# Muon-Rate-for-Different-Geometries
This project aims to calculate the rate of muons passing through different simplified geometries meant to simulate the module configurations of the IceCube Upgrade. It serves as a first step for a future full simulation. 

The code in this repository is written in the context of obtaining the bachelor of Science in Physics at the Humboldt University Berlin, Germany, titled "Estimating the Rate of Atmospheric Muons Crossing mDOMs in
the IceCube Upgrade". It uses the resources made available by the Deutsches Elektron-Synchrotron and the IceCube Collaboration. The main package used in all the code to estimate the flux of muons is the  DAta-drivEn
MuOn-calibrated atmospheric Neutrino Flux (DAEMONFLUX), found here: https://github.com/mceq-project/daemonflux .
